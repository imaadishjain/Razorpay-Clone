# Razorpay-Clone

Hello Connections,

I'm glad to share my Major Project of Frontend Development, clone of Razorpay website.

Razorpay is E-payment  website  which is use by  multiply companies across the nations.



Technologies Used-HTML,CSS and Tailwindcss.



Overall project is divided into multiplies section as-

1.Nav bar.

2.Hero section.

3.Feature section-1.

4.Feature section-2.

5.New feature.

6.Core feature.

7.Join razorpay section.

8.Testimonial section.

9.CTA.

10.Footer.



Apart from aligning and managing the images,contents and animations of the project I also manage to add the @mediaqueries which makes the website more Responsive(as the dimensions of view port changes the structure and css properties also changes) which make this website  different from anyother clone websites.



After the successfull completion of this project I got a chance to skill up my profile  on a new frame work of Frontend Development-Tailwindcss which is much more efficient and effective from classic CSS.
